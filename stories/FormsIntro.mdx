# Forms in Litform

Litform provides a set of components for building forms using Bootstrap's standard styling. All
of Litform's form components are built for accessibility and sticking with Bootstrap's defaults as
much as possible.

All Litform form components are _controlled_, meaning they expect a value and a change handler to be
passed in (and don't manage their own state for the value of the form element).

## Form groups (with labels)

The fundamental building block of form elements in Litform is a form group. This corresponds to the
(now-removed) `form-group` class in Bootstrap. A form group includes a wrapper `<div>`, a `<label>`,
a form element, and optionally help text and invalid input feedback.

Litform provides a low-level component called `<FormGroupWithLabel>` that implements this pattern.
As its `children` prop, `<FormGroupWithLabel>` expects a render function that accepts a parameter
called `id`, which will be a string containing the `id` to use for the form element. This is how
Litform connects the `<label>` tag to the form element. The `id` is generated automatically and is
guaranteed to be unique for the page.

You probably don't need to use `<FormGroupWithLabel>` directly. Instead, use the basic form element
components (described below) that are built on it.

## Basic form elements

Litform's basic form element components are:

- BootstrapFormCheckbox (check boxes and radio buttons)
- BootstrapFormInput (text, number, email, etc. inputs)
- BootstrapFormSelect (dropdown selectors)
- BootstrapFormTextarea (multi-line text areas)

These correspond roughly to the basic HTML form input tags (with the exception of the fact that
there are separate components for checkbox/radio and text `<input>`s). You can pass in almost any
props that you could use with the underlying HTML tag. The only exception to this is `onChange`.
In order to make these components easier to work with, Litform abstracts away the React change event
and replaces it with a similarly-named prop that takes a more primitive argument:

- BootstrapFormCheckbox: `onCheckedChange={(checked: boolean) => { ... }}`
- BootstrapFormInput: `onTextChange={(text: string) => { ... }}`
- BootstrapFormSelect: `onValueChange={(value: string) => { ... }}`
- BootstrapFormTextarea: `onTextChange={(text: string) => { ... }}`

All of these components are built on `<FormGroupWithLabel>`, so they expect to receive a `label`
prop and can take `helpText` and `invalidFeedback` as appropriate.

## ChoiceSets and MultipleChoiceInputs

It's often useful to combine several check boxes or radio buttons into a logical grouping that
represents a single value (or set of values) that can be selected. Litform provides two components
for this: `<ChoiceSet>` and `<MultipleChoiceInput>`.

`<ChoiceSet>` is a lower-level component that simply renders the set of radio buttons or check
boxes. It takes a `choices` prop, which is an array of objects with `label` and `value` keys.
It takes a `multiple` prop, which defaults to false (which will cause it to render radio
buttons; if `multiple` is true then it will render check boxes). It also takes `value` and
`onChange` props that let you treat the choice set as having a single value (a string in the case
of radio buttons, or an array of strings in the case of check boxes).

`<MultipleChoiceInput>` wraps `<ChoiceSet>` in a `<fieldset>` tag with a legend. This is very
nearly equivalent to what `<FormGroupWithLabel>` does, but slightly different because the markup
for doing this accessibly differs.

## CodeInput

Litform also ships with a wrapper for CodeMirror 6 called `<CodeInput>`. This is a fairly lightweight
wrapper component that injects CodeMirror into the page. It has a set of companion hooks; the
easiest one to use for most cases is `useStandardCodeMirror`. This hook will automatically
generate a series of CodeMirror extensions that are generally useful for Litform-based apps,
including a syntax highlighting theme that picks up whatever colors are being used by your site's
Bootstrap theme.

CodeMirror 6 is still in pre-release, and this set of components and hooks is very much in flux due
to that.
